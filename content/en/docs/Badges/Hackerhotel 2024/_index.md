* **ALLNET China** was our production partner, for which we are more than grateful. They took care of sourcing most components and oversaw the production process in [China](https://allnetchina.cn), saving us a lot of work and potential headaches and allowing us to focus on the product!
* **Espressif** was very generous to donate us all of the [ESP32-C6](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32-c6) modules we needed. The ESP32 series of WiFi capable microcontrollers has proven itself to be a solid basis for badges in the past. Espressifs continued support means a lot to us as it allows us to continue expanding our existing ESP32-based ecosystem!
